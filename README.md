## Add escape backslash scripted in bash
# I made a small script to add a escape character behind some characters

this is a small script you can use to generate a output with escape characters. 
Sometimes it handy to add them. 


You can fill a variable and add this to the command or integrate this in some bash script
'''bash
#for example you can do this
input=$(cat somefile.txt); ./this_script.sh $input
'''
